# The Coding Quiz

## Description 
This repository is used to create a day planner. The calendar renders based on data in local storage. If there is no data in local storage, the calendar renders with all the input sections blank. The inputs can be filled in and saved at any time. The input is color coded based on current time. The blue button at the top allows the user to switch the time format.

## Installation 
If all files are kept in a single folder a web browser should be able to run the project and you have an internet connection.

## Usage 
The usage of this is just for me to practice HTML, CSS, and javascript. It could be used to create a quiz.

## Credits 
I created this code based on the homework prompt created by Triology Education Services. Certain pieces of code I used online resources for help. In addition, several portions of code were created based on in class activities. I have included citations in the form of comments throughout the html and javascript.

## Contributing 
I was the only one to work on this project, but of course I had help from my instructor, TA's, and classmates.

## Challenges
To be added in future.
